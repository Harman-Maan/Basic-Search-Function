Hi!
This is for beginnners, who have already some knowledge of JavaScript. I think, I a post-beginner now, but not intermetidate.

In script.js I have explained everything using comments.
Feel free to use the code in any way. Although, I am not a professional, it is a simple search function to give you an idea of how basic search works.

You can also have a look at how to make a simple custom scrollbar and how to create tags in JavaScript and nest more tags in them. Also, a class constructor.

Images used are randomly picked from the internet.
